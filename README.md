# Motion-Rubberstamp

This is aimed at being a development tool, it will create an 
overlay for your iOS app icon that include your version and
commit information so you can know exactly what version of 
your app is running on your device.

TODO: insert example icon with before/after

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'motion-rubberstamp'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install motion-rubberstamp

This gem relies on imagemagick and ghostscript, which
can easily be installed via homebrew:

    $ brew install imagemagick

    $ brew install ghostscript

## Usage

First Rename your Icon files (where * is @2x, -568h etc.) to Icon_base, e.g.
Icon@2x_base.png

Run the new rake task:

    $ rake rubberstamp:run

Now when you next build your project, build information will be part of
your icon.

Unfortunately it appears that there's no build hook system available for
RubyMotion so this will have to be ran manually before each build, or
you'll need to write a custom rake task to Rubberstamp your icons and
then invoke the build.
